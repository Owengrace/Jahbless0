	<h2>About Us</h2>

	<p>In most common law countries, trust properties are those managed by one person, a group of people or organizations for the benefit of another. The modern rules of equity owe their origin and development to the English court of chancery and were formally received into the Nigerian legal system through various statutory enactments. Trust is an institution of equity which is received into the Nigerian legal system and just like all other equitable institutions and remedies, any claim arising from trust must be shown to have an ancestry founded in history and in the practice and precedents of courts administering equitable jurisdiction</p>
